# AMOLED-Cord V4
This is a temporary repository to gather feedback on v4 of AMOLED-Cord (hopefully, this is the last time I have to do something like this).

The purpose of this ~~yet another~~ rework is to make it more optimzied for OLED screens. I need feedback mainly on if colors blend too well together, as well as anything I have missed.

If you'd like to provide feedback, please either make an issue on this repo, or join my [support server](https://discord.gg/vYdXbEzqDs) and ping me with your feedback.
