# AMOLED-Cord Revised
This is a temporary repository to gather feedback on a revised version of AMOLED-cord. The purpose of this rivision is to make it more optimized for OLED screens. If you have an OLED screen, feedback from you is __**VERY**__ important. Once everything is finished, it will be moved to [this repository](https://github.com/discord-extensions/amoled-cord).

If you'd like to provide any feedback with the theme, please either make an issue on this repo or join my [support server](https://discord.gg/vYdXbEzqDs) and ping me with your feedback. Any form of feedback should include the following:
- The type of screen you have (whether it's OLED or something else).
- What issues you have with the theme (such as unthemed areas, areas being too dark, or stuff looking "off")

# Plan
The current version of AMOLED-cord will be maintained until I finish this project, which could be a while since I want to perfect this. After this version is ready, I will be archiving the old AMOLED-cord, so the old theme will still work until a Discord update begins breaking stuff.

I also feel like doing this makes more sense since the old theme wasn't that directed at OLED users, (stupid, right?) so I don't believe most of the people using it are using OLED screens.
